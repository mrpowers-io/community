# mrpowers-io GitHub organization

The mrpowers-io GitHub organization is owned by [Matthew Powers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-powers-cfa/) and [Sem Sinchenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semyon-a-sinchenko/) ("org owners").

The org owners are responsible for overseeing projects and reviewing project reports on a quarterly basis.

## Overseeing projects

The org owners are responsible for voting on new projects that will be added in the mrpowers-io organization.

The org owners are also responsible for monitoring the projects at a high-level including code quality, documentaion, the README, and repo activity.

mrpowers-io is generally for repos that are being actively developed and used.

## Managing repo permissions

The org owners will have to manage repo permissions from time-to-time.

The org owners may need to add a new maintainer to a repo if other repo owners don't have permissions, for example.

## Overseeing package manager permissions

Repos in the mrpowers-io organization will often be bundled and distributed via a package manager like Maven or PyPI.

Repo maintainers should also have access to make releases via package managers.

This ensures the package can continue being published in the event of an extreme event like a hardware failure, losing keys, or getting hacked.

## Quarterly project reports

Repo maintainers should submit project reports on a quarterly basis showing key metrics like the number or new contributors, number of new stars, PyPI downloads, etc.

The report should explain how the repo maintainers plan to grow the project in the upcoming quarter.

The mrpowers-io org is generally for projects that are being actively maintained with maintainers that are ambitiously growing the user base.

## Other org matters

The org owners are also responsible for voting in new org owners and strategizing how to get new projects.
