## Open Source Documentation best practices

Each project should have documentation that answers all user questions, is SEO optimized, and is fundamentally enlightening for the domain.

The Delta Lake docs should clearly explain how to add a column constraint but also educate users on ACID transactions and the Lakehouse category.

The Unity Catalog docs should educate users about volumes, why catalogs are important, and the importance of the AI catalog category.

Our docs should be world-class.
