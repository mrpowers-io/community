## Slack conversations

We should aim to respond to all Slack conversations.  Lots of answers should be to just encourage the users to create a GitHub discussion or send them a link to a blog post.  Slack conversations are more work than GitHub discussions because they’re not indexed by Google and disappear after a month (so the same question keeps getting asked).

It’s best to encourage community members to answer Slack questions, so we don’t have to do this work.  We should monitor Slack stats via CommonRoom, identify the top community contributors, and directly encourage them to keep answering questions / give them OSS care packages to say thank you.
