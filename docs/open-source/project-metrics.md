## Open Source Project metrics

Metrics for all projects are gathered on a monthly basis to make sure they're growing.  The maintainer efforts should be optimized based on the metrics.  Maintainers should focus on getting new contributors if the number of new committers is lacking.  They should focus on getting more downloads if there are not enough users.

## Specific metrics

Here are the project metrics that should be tracked on a monthly basis:

* Number of new contributors  
* GitHub stars  
* LinkedIn followers  
* PyPI downloads  
* Number of open isses/PRs

Some folks claim that these metrics are easy to game and I disagree.  For exmaple, it’s quite hard to get 10,000 GitHub stars without triggering a [fake stars algorithm](https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars).

Tracking metrics is a great way to fine-tune focus areas. If a project isn’t getting enough new contributors, focus on creating more issues with the “good first issue” label and responding to new contributors faster on GitHub.

If the LinkedIn community isn’t growing fast enough, then focus on making more social content.
