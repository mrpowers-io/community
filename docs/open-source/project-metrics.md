# Open Source Project metrics

Metrics for all projects are gathered on a periodic basis to make sure they're growing.  The maintainer efforts should be optimized based on the metrics.

It's generally best to track project metrics on a monthly basis, but quarterly is fine for less active projects.

Maintainers should focus on getting new contributors if the number of new committers is lacking.  They should focus on getting more downloads if there are not enough users.

## Specific metrics

Here are the project metrics that should be tracked on a monthly basis:

* Number of new contributors
* GitHub stars
* LinkedIn followers
* Project downloads
* Number of open isses/PRs
* Documentation pageviews

Let's start by talking about why "gaming" project metrics is a common objection to collecting them in the first place.

## Gaming project metrics

Some open source maintainers argue that it's futile to monitor metrics because it is easy to fudge the numbers, but we disagree.

Fudging an individual metric in an undetectable manner is actually hard.  It's easy to buy GitHub stars, but hard to do so without triggering a [fake stars algorithm](https://dagster.io/blog/fake-stars).

Gaming a whole basket of metrics would be quite challenging.  It would also be so obvious.  Each platform actively monitors fake activity and you'd likely get banned.

Gaming metrics is a choice and you don't need to do it.  You should let your project metrics grow organically, so they give you an accurate reading on the state of your project.

## Number of new contributors

GitHub shows the total number of contributors and you can track the delta on a periodic basis.

It's generally better to have more contributors, but great projects can be built with one or just a few developers as well.

Lots of projects are basically written by 1-3 devs, but have many contributors because of small PRs from the community.  That's fine too.

A growing contributor base generally indicates: 1. interest in the project, 2. engaged users, and 3. project maintainers that are merging community PRs.  More contributors is highly correlated with project health.

## Conclusion

Tracking metrics is a great way to fine-tune focus areas. If a project isn’t getting enough new contributors, focus on creating more issues with the “good first issue” label and responding to new contributors faster on GitHub.
