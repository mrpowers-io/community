# How to grow open source communities

## Community meetings

Projects should hold community meetings periodically to highlight external project contributions, and new features, and discuss the roadmap.

The meeting frequency should depend on the project's maturity.  A project that’s rapidly incubating may have community meetings on a biweekly basis and a project that’s rather mature may just have the meetings on a quarterly basis.

The community meetings should be recorded and posted on YouTube so they’re available to people who can’t attend live.

Community meetings will only appeal to a small set of overall users (only the users that have free time and are super interested in the latest developments, even the ones that are not relevant to their job).  Attendance for a community meeting will never be super-high, but they’re still an important component of community building.
