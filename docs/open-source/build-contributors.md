# How to acquire open source code contributors

Building a cool project with a welcoming community and clear steps for making pull requests can help you acquire contributors. Remember to always be welcoming to the community, as both contributors and our competitors are watching.

* The repo should have many issues with the “good first issue” label, with a variety of easy and medium-difficulty tasks. Some tasks should be code contributions, and others should be documentation tasks / trivial fixes.  We always want an easy on-ramp for someone that's making their first OSS contribution.

* Whenever a new contributor creates and issue or submits a pull request, we should respond quickly, be collaborative, and help them get their PR merged.

* We need to constantly reach out on LinkedIn, Slack, Reddit, and X to let the community know that we’re open for contributions.  We should always be actively recruiting new contributors.

## Contributor meetings

Projects should have contributor meetings on a monthly basis with the main OSS committers.

The contributor meetings give the valued OSS contributors direct access to the core developers, motivating and encouraging them to continue contributing.
